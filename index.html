							<br><br>As stated before my name is Jesse Doolan, I am from an Australian background I attended St. John Bosco’s primary school and then St. Bernards secondary school and am currently studying Information technology at RMIT university. My first language is English but I can also speak at an intermediate level of Japanese as I have been studying it for the past 6 years. I chose to study Japanese due to my interests in Japanese culture such as food, religion, anime and robotics. My Hobbies include skating, creating music, cars and almost everything pop cultured related (anime, games etc.) I am from a family of five including myself with a pet dog named milo.</p>

							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>My interest in IT is mainly coding and working on the hardware of computers (i.e. stripping them apart putting them back together) but mostly if not everything about computers I enjoy however the two interests listed above are definitely my favourites. My interest in IT started at an early age from playing computers games with my dad. As I grew up (around the age of 12) I got more interested in the actual hardware of computers and slowly fell into an obsession of tinkering with the insides of a computer and figuring out how to take apart and build a computer. By age 15 I learnt to code at school and thus a new obsession with creating programs using python was born. There was no particular event that sparked my interest, my love for technology existed from the day I was born and grew from there. I chose to come to RMIT because I heard from my teachers and counsellors that the IT department here was very good and could provide me with the knowledge and challenge to constantly push myself and improve. I also chose RMIT as it was close by to my home in Essendon as well as the fact that RMIT is a good place for me to obtain a career in IT for the future. Finally the community was one last reason why I joined IT. I expect to learn a lot more about coding using html 5 and java as I have not yet learnt how to use these coding languages before alongside coding I expect to learn more about what exact job/career I want to go into after my time at RMIT as at the moment I am unsure what exactly I want to do in IT. I hope that during my studies here I learn a lot more about the business side of IT (i.e. how to get a job, how to make good money in this industry and skills associated with a corporate higher up role).

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51776632?type=standout#searchRequestToken=ab93f997-250d-4408-ac69-a2c80b5ef354">Ideal Job Lisitng</a>

							<p>
								To my understanding this job is a management role where you are to overlook and manage the various systems, networks, firewalls, wireless systems and desktops, not only overlooking the systems and roles within the work place but also establishing relations with other companies to ensure growth of the company. Whats appealing to me about this role is the fact that you are in control of mostly everything to some extent within your area, I am somewhat of a control freak so the idea of overlooking everything is appealing to me. Also I am interested in establishing relations with other companies in meetings as the ‘politics’ involved in maintaining these relationships are very intricate yet exciting.

								The skills, qualifications and requirements to this job are a degree in either computer science or information technology, a minimum of 3 years experience in this area, extensive knowledge on Microsoft excel and other programs such as anti-virus and an understanding of business.

								The skills, qualifications and requirements that currently have, are a small understanding of html, a intermediate understanding of python, a low to intermediate understanding of user-centred design, a good understanding on computers (i.e. hardware, anti-virus and office 365) Aside from these few skills I intend to learn more throughout my time at RMIT so that I can achieve the goal of working in IT.

								To obtain these skills I will study at RMIT University to achieve a bachelor of Information Technology to firstly get me a job in the IT industry. Throughout my years here I intend to gain a wider knowledge of coding (python, html etc.) networking, security and user-centred design all in hopes to build up my repertoire. Once in the IT industry I plan on consistently building up my skills and hopefully obtain a promotion into a small management role and then finally achieve my ideal Job.</p>

							<h2>Myers-Briggs Test:</h2>
							<p>The results of this test don’t mean much to me. Most things mentioned in the results of the test are things that I already knew about myself and therefore not too surprising. Some points I disagree with, such as “being insensitive, enforcing order and being always by the book” these are qualities which I believe I do not have or have very little of.

These results may influence my behaviour in a team by trying to be a bit more relaxed and less of drill sergeant when it comes to dead lines and such. I will also try to see others perspectives and be less inclined to go with my ideas only rather try to find something that the whole group can understand and find passion in. Apart from these two factors I will continue to work hard for my group and get everything done ahead of schedule.

I should take this into account when forming a team as to find people with similar ideas/interests to create something that everyone enjoys and can partake in as well as to avoid people clashing heads. I will also try to form a group with people I can trust to get the work done in time for the submission date.</p>

						<h2>Learning Style Test:</h2>
						<p>The results of this test also don’t surprise me as I already deduced that I am a visual learner. Almost everything mentioned in the results of this test I agree with to some extent. Going forward I will continue to do the same strategies and techniques as I have done before as I know that they are effective for my learning style

These results will not influence my behaviour in any way shape or form as I already know what I need in a group setting with my learning style from my time in high school group projects. The only thing I can see myself changing is being more considerate that others may have a different learning style to me.

I should take this into account when forming a group as to also find other visual learners that increase productivity and make the ideas and work easier for everyone. Other than that I believe there is not much else to take into account when forming a group</p>

						<h2>The Big 5 Personality Test:</h2>
						<p>The results of this test are not too surprising the only thing that really caught me off guard was the low score in extroversion, I knew that I was introverted but I didn’t realise that I would score that low personally I would give myself a 50 at least. Everything else was stock standard and did not surprise me.

In light of these results, going into this project I will try to be more extroverted as to counter my introversion to establish a friendly and welcoming group environment that will provide good results and a smooth work flow.

When forming a team I will try to be extroverted to actually obtain a group that I will enjoying being apart of, rather than being assigned randomly into a group were our personalities and ideas clash. Aside from attempting to be more outgoing I will try and be more assertive to help get my point across.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p>For the project Idea I would like to develop a timetabling/to-do list smartphone app which allows a user to track there day to day tasks and upcoming events. This app will also provide daily reminders for important occasions such as assignments, meetings and presentations to not only remind the user of what needs to be done but allows them to input a quick progress report to keep up-to-date with their life. The daily progress report/reminder would be a quick rating system that would take less than 10 seconds to input and therefore not be a nuisance to the user.

I think this project will be interesting to me as I have never developed a smartphone app before and even though it is a daunting task as I have no experience or idea on where to start, I am very interested in trying new challenges. I also believe that this app will be useful to those who need a planner to keep themselves organised. The concept of a planner type app is not new and is actually commonplace in most starting smartphone app lineups, however I believe with the added feature of a progress report/reminder system is that it will help those stay on top of things more-so because the progress report function will be a constant reminder of how much the user has or hasn’t done encouraging them to stay ahead/on time.

The main function of this app is to be able to input tasks, events and schedules too organise and simplify the users lifestyle. This means that there will be a calendar that will allow users to add tasks, events and schedules. This will take form in a ‘+’ icon that gives users options to create the event and add it to a specific day/days. There will also be an option to set tasks and events as recurring which allows the user to create a functioning timetable. There will also be a function that allows users to edit pre-existing tasks. There will also be a reminder function, this function will provide the user with daily reminders that something is upcoming for example, the user has a test due in 5 days starting from a week before that day, there will be daily reminders that keep the user informed that the event is close. Paired with this there will be a progress report system that will work in tandem with the daily reminders. The progress report will be entering roughly how much the user has completed (0% - 100%, 100% being completed) these functions can be turned on/off when setting the tasks. Alongside the progress report there will be an option to also include a checklist that will follow conventional checklist functions. The UI is to minimalistic using icons and buttons that have a universal meaning making it easy for people of all ages to pick up and instantly understand the messages the app is trying to display. Upon opening the app the UI will consist of a calendar with various buttons on the top of the display similar to apple’s calendar UI. The buttons to be included on there are a plus icon for adding tasks, events and schedules, A minus icon to delete pre-existing tasks and a button that says ‘Checklist’ which will open a new UI that allow users to enter checklist entries which they can tick off as they complete them. The colour pattern for the UI is to be a combination of light and shaded colours to give the app a look of simplicity and accessibility to once again communicate to all ages how the app works.

The software needed can be one app development program such as MIT app Inventor, Siberian CMS – Open Source App Building, Swiftic or Shoutem. Hardware needed will be computers (Laptops or desktops) for creating the actual app and phones for testing the app and making sure everything works well. Computer hardware requirements are a processor with a minimum of 1GHz, a wifi or ethernet connection, minimum hard drive space of 32Gb and a minimum memory (RAM) of 1Gb. For phones they must be an android device on the latest firmware, with a working touchscreen.

The skills required will be analytical skills, communication, creativity, problem solving and programming languages. Analytical skills are important for discerning what the app needs for the target audience of people aged 18 to 60. Communication will be needed to work within a group to achieve the best outcome and to properly communicate ideas and concerns to the group. Creativity and problem solving will be important for tackling the various problems which can arise. Finally programming languages will be important because without them it will be impossible to create an app. I believe it will be easy to obtain the hardware and software needed for this project however obtaining the skills will be the difficult part. With the help of the internet and its sources I do believe however that it can be done even if the final product isn’t fully functioning.

If the project is successful then the outcome will be a functioning timetable/planner app that the public can use for free. Everyone involved in the process will also gain valuable knowledge about app development going forward which will help push us closer to obtaining our degree after our 3 years at RMIT. This development will push the group to work harder and potentially even exhaust the group by the end of the project. The original problem will be solved by the app completing everything it was intended to do with zero to a little amount of bugs included.
